# EPADonationMatch
Match EPA Alumni donors to EPA staffers impacted by government shutdowns.

This project was created in response to a request by Charles Elkins of
the EPA Alumni Association to help match donors able to help out, with
EPA staffers financially impacted by a government shutdown (expected in
January of 2024, or possibly Februrary). The regulations on receiving
gifts as a government employee make helping employees tricky, so this
program not only matches up donors with recipients but makes sure we
stay within legal limits while doing so.
