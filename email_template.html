    <p class="lefty">{GreetingLine}</p>

    <p>Thank you for making a pledge to send a $20 gift card to each of {Pledge} separate recipients.  This will help EPA employees and SEE enrollees who are encountering difficulties in putting food on the table or buying essential medicine during this Shutdown period. Below is the list of your assigned recipients along with the store brand card they are requesting.</p>

    <p>Please buy each of them only one (1) $20 card (multiple cards would be illegal) that is specific to the store brand chosen by the recipient.  If the name of the store has an asterisk (\*) after it, please buy that person a physical card rather than an electronic card (ecard).</p>

    <p>Do not buy any of the recipients the type of card, such as VISA cards, that can be used as cash. It would be illegal for them to receive such cash cards under the ethics rules.</p>

    <p>Please let us know when you have sent a gift card to each of these recipients, by emailing us at <a href="mailto:epaalumni@aol.com">epaalumni@aol.com</a>, with the subject line “Gift Cards Purchased” and referencing your donor # which is <b># {Donor #}.</b></p>

    <p>If you encounter any difficulties, please contact us at <a href="mailto:epaalumni@aol.com">epaalumni@aol.com</a> with the subject line “Problem” and referencing your donor #.</p>

    <p>Instructions for how to purchase and provide your recipients with $20 gift cards are provided below. </p>

    <p align="center"><b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SENDING GIFT CARDS</b></p>

    <p class="lefty">There are two ways to send gift cards to the recipients. We strongly recommend the first option (e-gift cards) because it is fast and secure:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Purchasing an <b>electronic gift card (e-gift card)</b> <b>on the store website</b> and having the store send the card by email to the recipient. This is the safest and quickest way to support people.</li>

      <li>Purchasing a <b>physical gift card</b> <b>online</b> and having the store send the card by postal mail to the recipient. This is secure, but does not get support to current EPA employees and SEE enrollees as quickly as we would hope.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p class="lefty">We advise against purchasing a <b>physical gift card in the store</b> and mailing it to the recipient yourself. This method is unsafe due to recent fraudulent activity. There has been a rash of cases where thieves tampered with the card on display and then stole the funds before the intended recipient could cash it. You would be unaware that the card is useless to the recipient. If you must buy a card in a store, try to buy one that has been stored safely behind a counter rather than one that has been hanging on a rack.</p>

    <p class="lefty">Make sure you buy only a card usable in the store designated by the recipient, not a cash card which could be used in a variety of stores as cash. It would be <u>illegal</u> for the recipient to receive such a cash card from you.</p>

    <p align="center"><b>1. BUYING AN E-GIFT CARD ONLINE</b></p>

    <p class="lefty">Online gift cards have become more secure and are the preferred way for you to send a card to a recipient.  Choose the link below to the store that your recipient has chosen and paste it into your browser.  Follow the simple directions on the store’s site.  Consider including an encouraging note to the recipient.  Note any special instructions included with each store’s link below.</p>

    <p align="center"><b>2. BUYING A PHYSICAL GIFT CARD ONLINE</b></p>

    <p class="lefty">We suggest buying a physical card ONLY if the recipient has requested it (with an \* next to the store name).  A physical card has to be processed and then mailed, resulting in a delay of 5 to 10 days.</p>
